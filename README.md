# TileGame
Simple c++/allegro5 tile game.

This is a project I started during my fall 2015 work term to gain some
shred of experience related to game development. It's written in c++
and uses the allegro game library. I wanted to make something that did
not depend heavily on assets and artwork so I could focus almost
exclusively on core gameplay.

Use the arrow keys to navigate the maze and collect all of the coins
while avoiding enemies.

"game.out" Is the current build of the game. You need to have the Allegro library installed to run or compile the game (http://liballeg.org/download.html)

The main is located in "game.cpp" if you're interested in following
the code.

If you have any questions/issues/suggestions feel free to send an email
to caw742@mun.ca

cheers,
