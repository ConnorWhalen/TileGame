# TileGame
Simple c++/allegro5 tile game.

This is a project I started during my fall 2015 work term to gain some
shred of experience related to game development. It's written in c++
and uses the allegro game library. I wanted to make something that did
not depend heavily on assets and artwork so I could focus almost
exclusively on core gameplay.

The main is located in "game.cpp". In there you will also find the
terminal input I use to compile and my todos.

If you have any questions/issues/suggestions feel free to send an email
to caw742@mun.ca

cheers,
Connor
